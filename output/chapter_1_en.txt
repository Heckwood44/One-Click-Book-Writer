# Der erste Flug

**Chapter 1: The First Flight**

In the warm glow of the golden afternoon, deep in the mountains, lay a hidden dragon's cave. Here lived Fireheart, a small, brave dragon with glowing amber eyes. Today was no ordinary day for Fireheart. Today, he was to fly for the first time.

“You can do this, Fireheart,” his mother said lovingly, noticing his excitement. Her voice was as comforting as the crackle of a cozy fire.

Fireheart looked out over the ledge. The world out there seemed so big, so endless. His heart beat with excitement and a little bit of fear. “But what if I fall?” he asked with a trembling voice.

“You won’t fall,” his mother replied. “Within you burns the heart of a dragon. And dragons are born to fly.”

With those words in mind, Fireheart stepped to the edge of the ledge. He felt the wind gently caressing his scales, the warm rays of the sun encouraging him. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and... jumped.

For a moment, it felt as if he were falling. But then, with a powerful beat of his wings, he took off. Fireheart was flying! Below him, the majestic landscape unfolded, and a feeling of freedom surged through him. He laughed with joy, a laugh that echoed through the mountains.

“I’m flying! I’m really flying!” he exclaimed. His mother watched him from the entrance of the cave, a smile of pride on her lips.

When Fireheart finally returned, he landed gently and skillfully on the ledge. His eyes sparkled with pride and joy. “I did it, Mom! I flew!”

“Yes, you did, my little dragon,” his mother said, hugging him. “You found your courage and saw what you’re capable of.”

Fireheart felt his confidence grow. He now knew he could face any challenge as long as he believed in himself. And with a heart full of courage and a thirst for adventure, Fireheart looked forward to the future, ready for the next flights and the stories yet to be written.
